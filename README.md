# About_Project
In my recent major project, I developed a comprehensive online food ordering system, designed to streamline the food ordering and delivery process for restaurants. The project involved creating a user-friendly interface for customers, an efficient backend for restaurant management, and a robust system for delivery tracking. Technologies used included HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.
